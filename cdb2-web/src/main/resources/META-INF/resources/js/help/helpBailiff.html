            <p>This page allows you to manage the bailiffs in your National Bailiff Directory.
            <h2>How it works ?</h2>
            <h3>Page structure</h3>
            <p>The upper part of this page contains a set of criteria to filter out the list of bailiffs and ease the research of a specific bailiff. Simply enter a value in
                the filter fields and the list is automatically updated with the bailiffs that match this criteria. The match is done on any part of the corresponding value of the
                Bailiff.</p>
            <p>The lower part of the page contains the list of bailiffs. The two arrows next the title at the top of the list are used to sort the list of bailiffs with this column values.
               On top of the list, you can choose the size to display per page.
               If the number of bailiffs is greater to the page size, there is a pagination mechanism that appears on top of the list.
               You can navigate through the pages by selecting a specific page or by using the arrows to go to the previous/next page.</p>
