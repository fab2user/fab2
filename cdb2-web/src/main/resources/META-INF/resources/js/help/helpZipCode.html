            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>This page allows you to manage the ZIP Code.
            <h2>How it works ?</h2>
            <p>This page allows you to manage the list of ZIP codes of your country.
            There is no direct edition of a zip code but instead the list is updated by a file upload process. 
            The button 'Choose a file' allows you to select a file that contains all the ZIP codes of your country.
            Once the file is selected, you push the 'import data' button to start the upload process. This operation can take a while.</p>
            <p>The format of the file is the one used by the <a target="#" href="https://www.geonames.org/" >GeoNames.org</a> site.
            You can find a download page of existing ZIP code sets <a target="#" href="http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/">here</a>. As this site is a cooperative site, please check the accuracy of the data before importing it.</p>
            <p>If you upload a ZIP code file while there is already existing zip codes in the application, the file is compared with the existing zip codes and only new values are uploaded.
            If the file doesn't contain a ZIP code, this one is not removed from the list.</p>
